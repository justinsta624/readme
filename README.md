### Vite for React: Steps to follow

* To serve as a tool for quickly setting up and developing modern web applications, like React.
* Focuses on providing a fast development experience by leveraging ES module imports, pre-bundling dependencies during development, and optimizing build times.

1. In the command line, navigate to the desired parent folder and run `npm create vite@latest`.
2. Enter the desired name of new project folder.
3. From the first list of options, select framework; for activities in class, we'll be using `React`.
4. From the second list of options, select variant; for activities in class, we'll be using `JavaScript`.
5. `cd` into your newly created project folder and run `npm install`.
6. Run `npm dev`/`npm run dev` and navigate to the prompted URL to see application.

### Further customization

1. Navigate to `package.json` and modify the `scripts` object so that it looks like this example:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
```

2. Navigate to the `vite.config.js` file and edit the export object so that it looks like this example:
```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true
  }
})
```

source ./db/schema.sql
```
5. Exit MySQL2:
```
quit
```
6. Optional - you can seed some data into the database while you are in mysql2 (Skip this step if you are going to use real data)
```
source ./seeds/seed.sql
```
7. You can run start the server once packages have been installed and the database is created. Run the below in the CLI:

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## What to expect for this challenge?

* To build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code
* To configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database
* Your application should use [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
* Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
* To provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. </br>
  [Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide)
* Your walkthrough video should also shows the application's GET routes to return all -and- single categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.
* Your walkthrough video should also shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.

## Associations

To execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:
* `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.
* `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.
> **Hint:** Make sure you set up foreign key relationships that match the column we created in the respective models.

## Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations
Fill out the unfinished routes in `product-routes.js`, `tag-routes.js`, and `category-routes.js` to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.
Note that the functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products has already been completed for you.
> **Hint**: Be sure to look at the mini-project code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what `req.body` will be for POST and PUT routes!

## Seed the Database
After creating the models/routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.
</br>

## Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start
Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
</br>

<summary> Motivation for development </summary> <br />


```
We created this project because of the increase in the current movie market and to create a user
friendly environment to help individuals to browse trailers and choose specific movies they would prefer.

The rising popularity of streaming services in todays time increases the demand to not only websites
that show movies but also sites that offer specific space to be able to view and discover new movie
trailers that match their taste.

Adding and partnering with movie streamers or potentially starting our own with a subscription would
be a great way to further enhance this project. Movie trailers are also a great way to engage and
captivate user audiences pulling them into their own movie world. Our website and our motivation also
lies in the great diversity within our site.

Allowing discover films they might have otherwise never known existed, or a genre they might like which
they had not thought about. With today’s consumer behavior of preferring bite size and visually
appealing content, our website is ideal as it allows users to watch trailers and decide on their own
weather they’d like to go view this movie.

Another reason for this project is by adding these external API’s, alongside with meeting project
requirements, we’ve been able to integrate high quality content for users and allows them to find exactly
what they are looking for.

<summary> User Story </summary> <br />


```
Being the movie enthusiasts that we are, we were aiming to create a website that makes it easier for
us to view and easily navigate through an extensive collection of movies to pick and chose.

We also wanted a way to save possible movies into local storage to be able to revisit them at our
own convenience, for when we obtain a chance to view and watch a movie.This website allows me curated
section for my chosen trailers, allowing me to save and revisit at my own discretion.

It enables me to easily explore endless movies, many unheard of, all while keeping the website engaging.

<summary> Directions for Future Development </summary> <br />

  
```
An aspect for future development is to add watch history to allow users to be able to find a possible
movie that they may have “lost”. 

This website can also be enhanced by adding additional API’s to fetch live user reviews and ratings 
based on certain movies. We intend to continuously enhance our website possibly creating a mobile
application, so users will be able to watch trailers for potential movies on the go and save for later
preference. 

We can also go ahead and potentially create partnerships so our website is redirected to a possible movie
website such as Netflix or Disney+. Another possibility for future development is to add a downloading
feature to allow users to download their favourite trailers for offline viewing to allow them to access
on possible travels so they know which movie is next on their watch list. 

For other possibilities is adding a real time virtual watch parties to allow users to be able to to watch
and chat in real time. If possible they may be allowed to rate movies in real time. 

If this website is a success we can proceed to add an additional website to present the actual movies
people would like to watch, and possibly adding a cheap user friendly website that allows individuals
to save and present movies to their peers. This would mean an addition of being able to share trailers and
websites on multiple social platform. 

Overall there’s potential for this website to grow in multiple directions that will have to be tackled
one at a time.
