# Introduction
```
This is our movie trailer platform.

This is where you can be the next potential movie critic and enthusiast.
Our users get to view more movie trailers they can possibly comprehend to find the next
perfect movie for them. Using and integrating Youtube API and ODMP API, you get access from
blockbuster films to hidden gems to movies 20 years old and beyond.

What makes us unique and different from other sources is that you’re not just a viewer
but you’re also a creator. By choosing and saving your favorite movies you get to create
a trailer environment that is just specifically enhanced and handpicked for you. Easily 
save your favorite trailers, creating a personalized collection that perfectly reflects your
unique taste. It's a personalized library that you’ve hand chosen to be your own movie sanctuary.

Our platform is more than just watching trailers and discovering your next favorite trailer,
its a community, allowing you to go out into the world and engage with fellow movie enthusiasts
and watch new trailers together.

Allow our website to help you uncover hidden gems and cinematic treasures to find new movies and new
recommendations with the latest data and movies . This is just a beginning, we are constantly
working to improve and enhance user engagement.

It’s like a free show where you can access as many captivating and user engaging trailers
you may possibly desire.
```

# Motivation for development

```
We created this project because of the increase in the current movie market and to create a user
friendly environment to help individuals to browse trailers and choose specific movies they would prefer.

The rising popularity of streaming services in todays time increases the demand to not only websites
that show movies but also sites that offer specific space to be able to view and discover new movie
trailers that match their taste.

Adding and partnering with movie streamers or potentially starting our own with a subscription would
be a great way to further enhance this project. Movie trailers are also a great way to engage and
captivate user audiences pulling them into their own movie world. Our website and our motivation also
lies in the great diversity within our site.

Allowing discover films they might have otherwise never known existed, or a genre they might like
which they had not thought about. With today’s consumer behavior of preferring bite size and visually
appealing content, our website is ideal as it allows users to watch trailers and decide on their own
weather they’d like to go view this movie.

Another reason for this project is by adding these external API’s, alongside with meeting project
requirements, we’ve been able to integrate high quality content for users and allows them to find
exactly what they are looking for.
```

# User Story

```
Being the movie enthusiasts that we are, we were aiming to create a website that makes it easier for
us to view and easily navigate through an extensive collection of movies to pick and chose.

We also wanted a way to save possible movies into local storage to be able to revisit them at our
own convenience, for when we obtain a chance to view and watch a movie.This website allows me curated
section
for my chosen trailers, allowing me to save and revisit at my own discretion. It enables me to easily
explore endless movies, many unheard of, all while keeping the website engaging.
```

# Project Requirements

```
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a

* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards
  (file structure, naming, follows class/id naming, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (unique name, description, technologies, screenshot, and deployed application).
```

# Presentation Requirements

```

![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-OMDb-indigo)

**Updated version of this application can be found at:** https://github.com/kishan0725/The-Movie-Cinema

Content Based Recommender System recommends movies similar to the movie user likes and analyses the sentiments on the reviews given by the user for that movie.

The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using `beautifulsoup4` and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.

## The Movie Cinema

I've developed a similar application called "The Movie Cinema" which supports all language movies. But the only thing that differs from this application is that I've used the TMDB's recommendation engine in "The Movie Cinema". The recommendation part developed by me in this application doesn't support for multi-language movies as it consumes 200% of RAM (even after deploying it to Heroku) for generating Count Vectorizer matrix for all the 700,000+ movies in the TMDB. 

Link to "The Movie Cinema" application: [https://tmc.kishanlal.dev/](https://tmc.kishanlal.dev/)

Don't worry if the movie that you are looking for is not auto-suggested. Just type the movie name and click on "enter". You will be good to go eventhough if you made some typo errors.

## How to get the API key?

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.

# How to run the project?

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install all the libraries mentioned in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/kishan0725/Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/requirements.txt) file with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Get your API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/. (Refer the above section on how to get the API key)
3. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in **both** the places (line no. 15 and 29) of `static/recommend.js` file and hit save.
4. Open your terminal/command prompt from your project directory and run the file `main.py` by executing the command `python main.py`.
5. Go to your browser and type `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in the address bar.
6. Hurray! That's it.

## Similarity Score : 

   How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here come the similarity scores.
   
   It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
   
## How Cosine Similarity works?
  Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
