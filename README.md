to hidden gems to movies 20 years old and beyond.

unique taste. It's a personalized library that you’ve hand chosen to be your own movie sanctuary.

Our platform is more than just watching trailers and discovering your next favorite trailer, its a
community, allowing you to go out into the world and engage with fellow movie enthusiasts and
watch new trailers together.

<summary> Motivation for development </summary> <br />


```
We created this project because of the increase in the current movie market and to create a user
friendly environment to help individuals to browse trailers and choose specific movies they would prefer.

The rising popularity of streaming services in todays time increases the demand to not only websites
that show movies but also sites that offer specific space to be able to view and discover new movie
trailers that match their taste.

Adding and partnering with movie streamers or potentially starting our own with a subscription would
be a great way to further enhance this project. Movie trailers are also a great way to engage and
captivate user audiences pulling them into their own movie world. Our website and our motivation also
lies in the great diversity within our site.

Allowing discover films they might have otherwise never known existed, or a genre they might like which
they had not thought about. With today’s consumer behavior of preferring bite size and visually
appealing content, our website is ideal as it allows users to watch trailers and decide on their own
weather they’d like to go view this movie.

Another reason for this project is by adding these external API’s, alongside with meeting project
requirements, we’ve been able to integrate high quality content for users and allows them to find exactly
what they are looking for.

<summary> User Story </summary> <br />


```
Being the movie enthusiasts that we are, we were aiming to create a website that makes it easier for
us to view and easily navigate through an extensive collection of movies to pick and chose.

We also wanted a way to save possible movies into local storage to be able to revisit them at our
own convenience, for when we obtain a chance to view and watch a movie.This website allows me curated
section for my chosen trailers, allowing me to save and revisit at my own discretion.

It enables me to easily explore endless movies, many unheard of, all while keeping the website engaging.

<summary> Project Requirements </summary> <br />

```
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world
front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must
fulfil the following requirements:
```

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two [server-side APIs]
  https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources 
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards
  (file structure, naming, follows class/id naming, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (unique name, description, technologies, screenshot, and deployed application).

<summary> Directions for Future Development </summary> <br />

  
```
An aspect for future development is to add watch history to allow users to be able to find a possible
movie that they may have “lost”. 

This website can also be enhanced by adding additional API’s to fetch live user reviews and ratings 
based on certain movies. We intend to continuously enhance our website possibly creating a mobile
application, so users will be able to watch trailers for potential movies on the go and save for later
preference. 

We can also go ahead and potentially create partnerships so our website is redirected to a possible movie
website such as Netflix or Disney+. Another possibility for future development is to add a downloading
feature to allow users to download their favourite trailers for offline viewing to allow them to access
on possible travels so they know which movie is next on their watch list. 

For other possibilities is adding a real time virtual watch parties to allow users to be able to to watch
and chat in real time. If possible they may be allowed to rate movies in real time. 

If this website is a success we can proceed to add an additional website to present the actual movies
people would like to watch, and possibly adding a cheap user friendly website that allows individuals
to save and present movies to their peers. This would mean an addition of being able to share trailers and
websites on multiple social platform. 

Overall there’s potential for this website to grow in multiple directions that will have to be tackled
one at a time.
